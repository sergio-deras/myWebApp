Next steps:
* Use containers


Quick steps
* Create a CodePipeline
* Configure the source
* Configure a Build with CodeBuild
* Create a LConfig 
* Create a AS with 

sudo yum -y update
sudo yum install -y ruby
sudo yum install -y wget
sudo rpm -Uvh https://packages.microsoft.com/config/centos/7/packages-microsoft-prod.rpm
sudo yum install -y aspnetcore-runtime-3.1
cd /home/ec2-user
wget https://aws-codedeploy-us-east-1.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/latest/install
chmod +x ./install
sudo ./install auto

Two roles are needed
* One for the EC2 to access S3 artifacts
* One to allow CodeDeploy to use AS resources


Create with
- dotnet new webApp -o myWebApp --no-https

Build process
- dotnet build

Publish (create a deployable app in Win 64)
- dotnet publish -r win-x64

Publish an app cross-platform runtime-dependent. An executable that targets your current platform is created along with the dll file.
- dotnet publish

Publish a Linux x64 deployable
- dotnet publish -r linux-x64

You can indicate the output folder with -o
